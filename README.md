Solution for the item 2 of the Programming Test

Code written in C++ to attend item 2 of the Programming Skill Test:

"Write a C/C++ or Java program that prints each number from 1 to 100 on a new line.

For each multiple of 3, print "Foo" instead of the number.
For each multiple of 5, print "Baa" instead of the number.
For multiple numbers simultaneously of 3 and 5, print "FooBaa", instead of the number".

Test: Running the code in a C++ compiler will show the expected results, just as described above.
